# Mural Block

Poc machine learning based distributed storage network. balancing computational and storage loads across nodes in the distributed storage network, integrated my adaptivekmeans clustering functionality into this Rust project.

## Innovation Idea

I created a distributed storage network incorporating my enhanced AdaptiveKmeans C++ library, To dynamically balance computational and storage loads across nodes in a distributed storage network. This approach ensures optimal performance and resource utilization by adjusting node resources based on data clustering results. Adjust the clustering logic and resource allocation methods as per your specific requirements and data characteristics to achieve optimal results.

## Usage

This is still a proof of concept and cannot be used at this stage but can be a guide how to achieve this ambitious idea.
